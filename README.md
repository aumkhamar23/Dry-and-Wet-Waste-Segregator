# Dry-and-Wet-Waste-Segregator
Project Overview:
This project focuses on developing an AI-based waste classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify waste into wet and dry categories. The model was trained on a custom dataset and achieved 79.9% validation accuracy, demonstrating its potential for smart waste management solutions.

Key Features:
âœ… Deep Learning-Based Waste Classification: Utilized a CNN model to classify waste images as wet or dry with high accuracy.
âœ… Custom Dataset: Trained the model on a dataset containing categorized waste images.
âœ… Detection: Implemented a image-based detection system using OpenCV, allowing real-time waste classification.
âœ… Preprocessing Techniques: Used image augmentation, normalization, and batch processing to improve model performance.
âœ… Model Performance: Achieved 98.9% training accuracy and 79.9% validation accuracy, with efforts to minimize overfitting.
